# paper sat moving masses

This paper is about an idea to have satellites move masses internally to alter the rotation around earth to sustain the orbit. This would make it possible to have them orbit around earth without fuel.

This paper is far from finished at the moment it is written in german until the idea is complete then i will translate it into english.
